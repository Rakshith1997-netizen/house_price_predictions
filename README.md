# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

A regression-based project that predicts house prices based on key features such as location, area, number of rooms, and more.

---

## 📂 Repository Contents

- `house.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, preprocessing, and model training
- `housing.csv` — Dataset with housing information (features and target variable)

---

## 📌 Objective

The aim is to build a regression model that can **accurately estimate the price of a house** based on:

- Location
- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Additional amenities or property features

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for EDA and visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for regression modeling

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Linear Regression and other regression models
- Model Evaluation (RMSE, MAE)

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `house.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any IDE supporting `.ipynb` files
3. Run through the notebook for full data workflow and model results

---

## 💡 Project Outcome

The model provides estimated house prices and helps understand which features impact pricing the most — useful for buyers, sellers, or real estate analysts.
